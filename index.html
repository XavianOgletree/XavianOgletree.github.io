                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate software developer that's always eager to explore new technologies and ideas. 
                    I have specialized in interactive audio-visual development for mobiles platforms. However, I am 
                    well versed in developing desktop, web, and cloud applications. I find joy in being able to 
                    explore new ideas and problems. Additionally, I regularly start projects to learn new skills. 
                    I've included a selection of these projects in the sidebar.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019, I led a team of 3 other students in building a dynamic AR 
                    picture book system. It featured real-time feedback for words the reader read correctly, read 
                    incorrectly, or skipped over. It required combining augmented reality (AR), automatic speech 
                    recognition (ASR), and natural language process (NLP). We had a week to build and record our 
                    final demonstration. Our work had managed to leave a meaningful impression on our university. So 
                    much so, our college used it to showcase what other highly motivated students could find themselves 
                    creating at the school.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work would later evolve into my thesis project. My research 
                    explored the realm of advanced human-AI teaming. Utilizing my previous AR experiences, I led the 
                    development of a training simulation based around a virtual expert in Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
                    The goal of this project was to take players through a virtual office session between them and a 
                    student with ASD. You can read all the details in my paper <a target="_blank" href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=wright1621853024907269&disposition=inline">Human-AI Teaming for Dynamic Interpersonal Skill Training.</a>
